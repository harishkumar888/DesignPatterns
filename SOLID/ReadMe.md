<h3>Single-responsibility principle</h3>
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

<h3>Open-closed principle</h3>
Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

<h3>Liskov substitution principle</h3>
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

<h3>Interface segregation principle</h3>
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

<h3>Dependency inversion principle</h3>
Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. High level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should both depend on abstractions.
